    YOUR CODE IS STARTING HERE

    Test the UserNameAndPassword class setUsername method

    Check all the possible options.

    NOTE :  For each possibility you need to create a different @Test method
    For Example  one of the condition is if the UserNameLists has myusername , you are supposed to create your test case for this.
    You will do the same approach for each condition of the both methods.
